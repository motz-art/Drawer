				<h1>What's Drawer?</h1>
				<p>Drawer is online drawing tool for creating simple block-schemes.</p>

				<h1>Drawing figures with Drawer.</h1>
				<p>Creating figures with drawer is really easy - you have just to draw it with the mouse! 
				To start drawing - just point your mouse to the place where you want to create a figure, press left 
				button on the mouse and draw a closed line. Don't worry if your line or the outlined figure
				aren't absolutely straight - drawer will fix it!</p>
				<p>Got wrong figure? Just cross (X-cross) it!</p>
				
				<h1>Dragging of figures.</h1>
				<p>As soon as you create your figures you can drag them! Try it! It's really cool!</p>
				
				<h1>Drawing connections between figures.</h1>
				<p>Don't you know? If you draw a straight line between two figures - they will be connected! 
				What does it mean? When you drag one of the figure - the connection will be updated automatically!</p>
				
				<h1>Typing text with Drawer.</h1>
				<p>Click at the place where you need to type your text and then just type it! It's easy, isn't it?</p>
				<p>One cool feature about your text - if you type a text inside any figure it will be connected 
				to it, so you'll drag it with the figure. Try it and see!</p>
				
				<h1>It's not the end!</h1>
